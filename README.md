The story begins when **Hughie Campbell** joins Butcher after a superhero kills his girlfriend, pulling him into a world filled with:

##  Why I Love It
> “Sometimes the good guys aren’t so good, and the bad guys aren’t all bad.”

I love *The Boys* because it flips the superhero genre on its head.  
It’s dark, witty, and brutally honest about how power corrupts — a thrilling mix of **action, satire, and morality**.
